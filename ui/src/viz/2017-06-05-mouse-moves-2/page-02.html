<div class="container">
  <h1>PAGE 2</h1>
  <p>Now lets look at some data, the chart below show some things that I initially thought might be interesting, the distance from the edge of the green circle, the distance from the center of the circle, how much you were leading or lagging the circle and how much you were off the path of the perfect radius.</p>

  <p>This is part of my normal process when developing a new visualization just get some data onto the screen and see how it looks.</p>

  <div class="viz-wrapper">
    <div id="canvas" style="margin: 1rem 0rem;" class="is-fullwidth is-clearfix"></div>
    <div id="key" class="vizkey"></div>
  </div>

  <p>Now lets try to make this a bit more informative, the charts above are hard to relate to the path your mouse took.</p>

  <div class="viz-wrapper">
    <div id="canvas2" style="margin: 1rem 0rem;" class="is-fullwidth is-clearfix"></div>
    <div id="key2" class="vizkey"></div>
  </div>
