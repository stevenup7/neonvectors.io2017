<div class="container">
  <p>I wanted some data to visualize, and was hunting around the web for something interesting, then I lost my internet connection and decided I would just make some data of my own.<p>
  <p>Click the green circle, it will follow around the large circle in a clockwise direction, try to keep the mouse in the center of the green circle. You will get one practice run then the next 3 will be recorded and used as data for the visulizations on the following pages.</p>
