# Start of Development

[dev] [neonvectors.io]

Conor just started a new job and does not have time for making a new website so I'm doign it on my own.

I have a few goals for this build:

* learn some new tech
* catch up on css/sass since I have been in jobs where it was another team building this for me over the last few years.

Trying to pick a lightweight node framework for this project, something that wont get in the way of the main gloals of the project. My first google search came up with [vanilla.js](http://vanilla-js.com). This seemed a little too light for my tastes/needs.

Then my friend [dotDeeka](https://github.com/dotDeeka) recommended Vue.js which fits the bill really nicely its super light.
